# pytorch-cifar10-experiments
Image classification on CIFAR-10 using CNN and ResNet in PyTorch. Includes training, evaluation, and experiment notes.

## Results

This repository includes training experiments on CIFAR-10 using a custom CNN built with PyTorch.

- Training accuracy reaches **~96%** after ~65 epochs.
- Training loss decreases smoothly, showing stable convergence.
- Full training curves are available in [`results/`](results):

  - [Training loss curve](results/loss_curve.png)
  - [Training accuracy curve](results/accuracy_curve.png)

Test-set evaluation will be added as a next step.
